# ReadWriteCSVFileWithJava
In this project we have input sample file given with few columns like: 
   city  country  gender  currency amount
Out file should contain below columns
  City/Country  gender  averageAmountInUSD
  Rules for Output files are as follows:
    we need average output of amount in USD only.
    Output should be in sorted order based on gender.
    If we have country and city both output should be calculated based on country.
    If country is missing then output should be calculated based on City.
    You need to calculate average based on gender for female and male separately.
